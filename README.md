# Python Fundamental
## Diameter Circumference Calculator
### Part 1

The circumference of a circle is calculated by `2πr`, where `π = 3.14159` (rounded to five decimal places). 
Write a function called `print_circum` that receive an argument for the circle’s radius and prints the circle's circumference.
Call your `print_circum` function three times with different values for radius.

- Include the following:
  - The code for your `print_circum` function. 
  - The inputs and outputs to three calls of your `print_circum`.
